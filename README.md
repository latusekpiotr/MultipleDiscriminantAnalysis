# MultipleDiscriminantAnalysis
Component Analysis and Multiple Discriminant (Matlab)

This repository contains a paper that covers the topic of feature extraction and projections. Two important techniques for analyzing data are described â€“ Principal
Component Analysis and Multiple Discriminant Analysis.

There is also some example code in Matlab that shows how the methods above can be used in practice for feature extraction.
